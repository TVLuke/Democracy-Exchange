## Seat Calculation Process

## Austrian Electoral System Explanation

This election is calculated using the Austrian three-tier proportional representation system:

1. **Regional Constituency Level (Regionalwahlkreise)**
   - In this election: 39 regional constituencies across 9 states
     (The Austrian system typically has 39 constituencies across 9 states)
   - First distribution of seats using the Hare quota
   - Only parties that reach 4% nationally can receive seats
   - Direct mandates are awarded at this level

2. **State Level (Landeswahlkreise)**
   - States in this election:
     - Burgenland: 2 constituencies
     - Kärnten: 4 constituencies
     - Niederösterreich: 7 constituencies
     - Oberösterreich: 5 constituencies
     - Salzburg: 3 constituencies
     - Steiermark: 4 constituencies
     - Tirol: 5 constituencies
     - Vorarlberg: 2 constituencies
     - Wien: 7 constituencies
   - Second distribution using state-level electoral numbers
   - Remaining seats distributed using D'Hondt method
   - Takes into account seats already won at regional level

3. **Federal Level (Bundesebene)**
   - Final distribution of remaining seats
   - Uses Hare quota at national level
   - Ensures overall proportional representation
   - Compensates for any disproportions from lower levels

Key Features:
- 4% threshold nationally or one direct mandate required
- 183 total seats to be distributed (Austrian National Council has 183)
- Seats first allocated to states based on citizen population

## State Level Distribution

According to §1 of the Nationalrats-Wahlordnung, the 183 seats are distributed among the states based on their citizen population.

The process:
1. Calculate state-level electoral number (Wahlzahl)
   For each state, the Wahlzahl is calculated as: Total valid votes ÷ (Number of seats + 1)
   Example for a state with 100,000 votes and 4 seats:
   Wahlzahl = 100,000 ÷ (4 + 1) = 20,000

2. Calculate Verhältniszahl (proportional number)
   Total population value: 6,346,059
   Total seats: 183
   Verhältniszahl = 6,346,059 ÷ 183 = 34,677.92
   This number represents how many electorate one mandate represents.

3. Determine remaining seats after direct mandates
4. Use D'Hondt method for remaining seats
5. Take into account party threshold requirement



## Final Distribution Summary

After completing all three levels of calculation:
1. Regional constituency direct mandates
2. State-level D'Hondt distribution
3. Federal level compensation

Final Results:
- FPÖ: 57 seats (31.1%) from 1,413,593 votes (28.8%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- ÖVP: 51 seats (27.9%) from 1,287,623 votes (26.2%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- SPÖ: 41 seats (22.4%) from 1,038,829 votes (21.2%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- NEOS: 18 seats (9.8%) from 450,285 votes (9.2%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- GRÜNE: 16 seats (8.7%) from 406,578 votes (8.3%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold

This distribution reflects the principles of proportional representation while accounting for:
- The 4% threshold requirement or direct mandate qualification
- Regional constituency direct mandates
- State-level proportionality using D'Hondt method
- Federal level compensation to ensure overall proportionality

### Parliament Seating

Parties from left to right: SPÖ with 41 seats (22.4%), GRÜNE with 16 seats (8.7%), NEOS with 18 seats (9.8%), ÖVP with 51 seats (27.9%), FPÖ with 57 seats (31.1%). Hinweis: Verteilung nutzt nur Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen).](../plots/austria2024_austria_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): ÖVP + FPÖ with 108 seats (59.0%, ideological distance: 1.0); SPÖ + FPÖ with 98 seats (53.6%, ideological distance: 4.0); SPÖ + GRÜNE + ÖVP with 108 seats (59.0%, ideological distance: 6.0); SPÖ + NEOS + ÖVP with 110 seats (60.1%, ideological distance: 6.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition SPÖ-GRÜNE-ÖVP: SPÖ: left_to_right = 1 GRÜNE: left_to_right = 2 ÖVP: left_to_right = 4 Ideologische Distanz = |1-2| + |1-4| + |2-4| = 6](../plots/austria2024_austria_coalitions.png)
