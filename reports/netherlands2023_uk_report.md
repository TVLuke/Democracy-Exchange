## Seat Calculation Process

# United Kingdom Electoral System
The UK uses First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting where:
- Each constituency (district) elects one Member of Parliament (MP)
- The candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins that seat
- No minimum threshold is required
- Normally, the total number of seats equals the number of constituencies (19 in this dataset)

In this calculation, the target number of seats is 150, which differs from the number of constituencies. This means we will need to scale the results proportionally after determining constituency winners.



## Constituency: Rotterdam

## Scaling Process Explanation
The UK system needs to scale from 19 constituencies to 150 total seats.

This scaling maintains proportionality through these steps:
1. Calculate scaling factor: 150 seats ÷ 19 constituencies = 7.8947
2. Multiply each party's constituency seats by this factor
3. Take the integer part first (floor)
4. Distribute remaining seats by highest decimal remainder

This preserves the proportional relationship between parties while reaching the target seat count.

Original seat distribution (showing only parties that won seats):
{
  "GL-PvdA": "3 seats (15.8%)",
  "PVV": "15 seats (78.9%)",
  "VVD": "1 seats (5.3%)"
}


Final seat distribution after scaling (showing only parties that won seats):
{
  "GL-PvdA": "24 seats (16.0%)",
  "PVV": "118 seats (78.7%)",
  "VVD": "8 seats (5.3%)"
}

Note how the percentage of seats for each party remains nearly identical after scaling,
demonstrating that the proportional relationships are preserved.

### Parliament Seating

Hinweis: Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen) werden (auch) wie Mandatsstimmen (Erststimmen) gewertet](../plots/netherlands2023_uk_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): PVV with 118 seats (78.7%, ideological distance: 0.0); VVD + PVV with 126 seats (84.0%, ideological distance: 2.0); GL-PvdA + PVV with 142 seats (94.7%, ideological distance: 6.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (PVV): PVV: left_to_right = 8 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/netherlands2023_uk_coalitions.png)
