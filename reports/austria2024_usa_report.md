## Seat Calculation Process

# United States House of Representatives Electoral System
The US uses First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting where:
- Each congressional district elects one Representative
- The candidate with the most votes (plurality) in each district wins that seat
- No minimum vote threshold is required
- Districts are redrawn every 10 years following the census
- Each state is guaranteed at least one Representative

In this calculation:
- Number of districts: 39
- Target number of seats: 183



## Congressional District: Niederösterreich Mitte

## Scaling Process Explanation
The US House system needs to scale from 39 districts to 183 total seats.

This scaling maintains proportionality through these steps:
1. Calculate scaling factor: 183 seats ÷ 39 districts = 4.6923
2. Multiply each party's district seats by this factor
3. Take the integer part first (floor)
4. Distribute remaining seats by highest decimal remainder

This preserves the proportional relationship between parties while reaching the target seat count.

Original seat distribution (showing only parties that won seats):
{
  "\u00d6VP": "15 seats (38.5%)",
  "SP\u00d6": "9 seats (23.1%)",
  "FP\u00d6": "15 seats (38.5%)"
}


Final seat distribution after scaling:
{
  "\u00d6VP": 71,
  "SP\u00d6": 42,
  "FP\u00d6": 70
}

### Parliament Seating

Hinweis: Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen) werden (auch) wie Mandatsstimmen (Erststimmen) gewertet](../plots/austria2024_usa_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): ÖVP + FPÖ with 141 seats (77.0%, ideological distance: 1.0); SPÖ + ÖVP with 113 seats (61.7%, ideological distance: 3.0); SPÖ + FPÖ with 112 seats (61.2%, ideological distance: 4.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition ÖVP-FPÖ: ÖVP: left_to_right = 4 FPÖ: left_to_right = 5 Ideologische Distanz = |4-5| = 1](../plots/austria2024_usa_coalitions.png)
