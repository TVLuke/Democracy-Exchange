### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab with 416 seats (64.0%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SNP with 425 seats (65.4%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + PC with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SDLP with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 0.0); Green + Lab with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + LD with 487 seats (74.9%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + APNI with 417 seats (64.2%, ideological distance: 1.0); SF + Lab with 423 seats (65.1%, ideological distance: 2.0); Ind + Lab with 423 seats (65.1%, ideological distance: 3.0); Lab + UUP with 417 seats (64.2%, ideological distance: 3.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (Lab): Lab: left_to_right = 3 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](plots/uk2024_france_coalitions.png)
