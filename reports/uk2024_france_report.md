## Seat Calculation Process

## French Electoral System Explanation

This election uses the French two-round voting system (scrutin uninominal majoritaire à deux tours):

1. **First Round**
   - All candidates can participate
   - If a candidate receives >50% of votes AND ≥25% of registered voters, they win immediately
   - Otherwise, qualified candidates proceed to second round

2. **Second Round Qualification**
   - Candidates need ≥12.5% of votes to qualify
   - If no candidates reach 12.5%, top two advance
   - When no second round data is provided, votes are simulated:
     * 80% of votes from eliminated parties go to parties with same left-right position
     * 30% of remaining votes go to parties within 1 position on left-right scale
     * Other votes are considered lost/abstentions

Key Features:
- 650 total seats to be distributed
- Single-member constituencies
- Two rounds if no absolute majority in first round

3. **Seat Scaling**
   When the required number of seats (650) differs from the number of districts (650),
   we use proportional scaling to maintain fair representation:
   - First calculate results for all districts
   - Then multiply each party's seats by (total_seats / number_of_districts)
   - Round to nearest whole number while preserving total seats
   - This maintains the proportional representation from the district results
   
   Example: If we have 100 districts but need 200 seats:
   - Party A wins 60 districts → scaled to 120 seats (60 * 200/100)
   - Party B wins 40 districts → scaled to 80 seats (40 * 200/100)
   The relative strength of each party remains the same.

Parties from left to right: Ind with 7 seats (1.1%), SF with 7 seats (1.1%), Green with 4 seats (0.6%), Lab with 416 seats (64.0%), SNP with 9 seats (1.4%), PC with 4 seats (0.6%), SDLP with 2 seats (0.3%), LD with 71 seats (10.9%), APNI with 1 seats (0.2%), UUP with 1 seats (0.2%), Con with 118 seats (18.2%), DUP with 5 seats (0.8%), TUV with 1 seats (0.2%), RUK with 4 seats (0.6%).

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab with 416 seats (64.0%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SNP with 425 seats (65.4%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + PC with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SDLP with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 0.0); Green + Lab with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + LD with 487 seats (74.9%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + APNI with 417 seats (64.2%, ideological distance: 1.0); SF + Lab with 423 seats (65.1%, ideological distance: 2.0); Ind + Lab with 423 seats (65.1%, ideological distance: 3.0); Lab + UUP with 417 seats (64.2%, ideological distance: 3.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (Lab): Lab: left_to_right = 3 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/uk2024_france_coalitions.png)
