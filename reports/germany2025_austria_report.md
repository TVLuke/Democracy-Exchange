## Seat Calculation Process

## Austrian Electoral System Explanation

This election is calculated using the Austrian three-tier proportional representation system:

1. **Regional Constituency Level (Regionalwahlkreise)**
   - In this election: 299 regional constituencies across 16 states
     (The Austrian system typically has 39 constituencies across 9 states)
   - First distribution of seats using the Hare quota
   - Only parties that reach 4% nationally can receive seats
   - Direct mandates are awarded at this level

2. **State Level (Landeswahlkreise)**
   - States in this election:
     - Baden-Württemberg: 38 constituencies
     - Bayern: 47 constituencies
     - Berlin: 12 constituencies
     - Brandenburg: 10 constituencies
     - Bremen: 2 constituencies
     - Hamburg: 6 constituencies
     - Hessen: 22 constituencies
     - Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: 6 constituencies
     - Niedersachsen: 30 constituencies
     - Nordrhein-Westfalen: 64 constituencies
     - Rheinland-Pfalz: 15 constituencies
     - Saarland: 4 constituencies
     - Sachsen: 16 constituencies
     - Sachsen-Anhalt: 8 constituencies
     - Schleswig-Holstein: 11 constituencies
     - Thüringen: 8 constituencies
   - Second distribution using state-level electoral numbers
   - Remaining seats distributed using D'Hondt method
   - Takes into account seats already won at regional level

3. **Federal Level (Bundesebene)**
   - Final distribution of remaining seats
   - Uses Hare quota at national level
   - Ensures overall proportional representation
   - Compensates for any disproportions from lower levels

Key Features:
- 4% threshold nationally or one direct mandate required
- 630 total seats to be distributed (Austrian National Council has 183)
- Seats first allocated to states based on citizen population



## Vote Type Used for Calculation

Using list votes (Zweitstimmen) for calculations. Although mandate votes (Erststimmen) are present, they are not used for proportional seat distribution in the Austrian system.

## State Level Distribution

According to §1 of the Nationalrats-Wahlordnung, the 630 seats are distributed among the states based on their citizen population.

The process:
1. Calculate state-level electoral number (Wahlzahl)
   For each state, the Wahlzahl is calculated as: Total valid votes ÷ (Number of seats + 1)
   Example for a state with 100,000 votes and 4 seats:
   Wahlzahl = 100,000 ÷ (4 + 1) = 20,000

2. Calculate Verhältniszahl (proportional number)
   Total population value: 713,478,000
   Total seats: 630
   Verhältniszahl = 713,478,000 ÷ 630 = 1,132,504.76
   This number represents how many citizens one mandate represents.

3. Determine remaining seats after direct mandates
4. Use D'Hondt method for remaining seats
5. Take into account party threshold requirement



## Final Distribution Summary

After completing all three levels of calculation:
1. Regional constituency direct mandates
2. State-level D'Hondt distribution
3. Federal level compensation

Final Results:
- CDU/CSU: 189 seats (30.0%) from 14,158,432 votes (28.5%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- AfD: 138 seats (21.9%) from 10,327,148 votes (20.8%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- SPD: 108 seats (17.1%) from 8,148,284 votes (16.4%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- GRÜNE: 77 seats (12.2%) from 5,761,476 votes (11.6%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- Die Linke: 58 seats (9.2%) from 4,355,382 votes (8.8%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- BSW: 32 seats (5.1%) from 2,468,670 votes (5.0%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- FDP: 28 seats (4.4%) from 2,148,878 votes (4.3%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold

This distribution reflects the principles of proportional representation while accounting for:
- The 4% threshold requirement or direct mandate qualification
- Regional constituency direct mandates
- State-level proportionality using D'Hondt method
- Federal level compensation to ensure overall proportionality

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): CDU/CSU + AfD with 327 seats (51.9%, ideological distance: 2.0); SPD + CDU/CSU + FDP with 325 seats (51.6%, ideological distance: 6.0); GRÜNE + SPD + CDU/CSU with 374 seats (59.4%, ideological distance: 8.0); Die Linke + GRÜNE + CDU/CSU with 324 seats (51.4%, ideological distance: 10.0); Die Linke + SPD + CDU/CSU with 355 seats (56.3%, ideological distance: 10.0); BSW + SPD + CDU/CSU with 329 seats (52.2%, ideological distance: 12.0); GRÜNE + SPD + AfD with 323 seats (51.3%, ideological distance: 12.0); Die Linke + SPD + FDP + AfD with 332 seats (52.7%, ideological distance: 24.0); BSW + GRÜNE + CDU/CSU + FDP with 326 seats (51.7%, ideological distance: 25.0); BSW + Die Linke + SPD + AfD with 336 seats (53.3%, ideological distance: 27.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition SPD-CDU/CSU-FDP: SPD: left_to_right = 4 CDU/CSU: left_to_right = 6 FDP: left_to_right = 7 Ideologische Distanz = |4-6| + |4-7| + |6-7| = 6](../plots/germany2025_austria_coalitions.png)
