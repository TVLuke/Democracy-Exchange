## Seat Calculation Process
## Electoral System Description


Das italienische Wahlsystem 'Rosatellum' für die Abgeordnetenkammer (Camera dei deputati):

Grundsätze:
- Gemischtes Wahlsystem mit zwei Komponenten:
  * 36% der Sitze durch Mehrheitswahl in Einerwahlkreisen (FPTP)
  * 64% der Sitze durch Verhältniswahl mit Parteilisten (PR)

Sperrklauseln:
- Einzelne Parteien: 3% der Gesamtstimmen
- Wahlbündnisse (Koalitionen): 10% der Gesamtstimmen
  * Mindestens eine Partei im Bündnis muss 3% erreichen

Besonderheiten:
- Eine Stimme zählt sowohl für Direkt- als auch Listenmandat
- Stimmen von Parteien zwischen 1-3% werden auf Koalitionspartner über 3% verteilt
- Parteien müssen Koalitionszugehörigkeit vor der Wahl erklären
- Verteilung der Verhältniswahlsitze nach dem Hare-Niemeyer-Verfahren
- Insgesamt 630 Sitze in der Abgeordnetenkammer

Ablauf der Sitzverteilung:
1. Direktmandate (36%):
   - In jedem Wahlkreis gewinnt der Kandidat mit den meisten Stimmen
   - 36% der Sitze werden durch Direktmandate vergeben (bei 630 Sitzen: 226 Sitze)

2. Verhältniswahlmandate (64%):
   - Nur Parteien über der Sperrklausel werden berücksichtigt
   - 404 Sitze nach Verhältniswahl mit Hare-Niemeyer
   - Restmandate nach größten Dezimalstellen

Dieses System wurde 2017 eingeführt und nach seinem Autor Ettore Rosato benannt.

## Visualizations
### Parliament Seating
![Parliament seating arrangement with 650 total seats. Parties from left to right: Ind with 28 seats (4.3%), Green with 49 seats (7.5%), Lab with 228 seats (35.1%), LD with 85 seats (13.1%), Con with 162 seats (24.9%), RUK with 98 seats (15.1%). Hinweis: Mandatsstimmen (Erststimmen) werden (auch) wie Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen) gewertet](../plots/uk2024_italy_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab + Con with 390 seats (60.0%, ideological distance: 4.0); Green + Lab + LD with 362 seats (55.7%, ideological distance: 4.0); Lab + RUK with 326 seats (50.2%, ideological distance: 5.0); Ind + Lab + LD with 341 seats (52.5%, ideological distance: 8.0); LD + Con + RUK with 345 seats (53.1%, ideological distance: 8.0); Lab + LD + RUK with 411 seats (63.2%, ideological distance: 10.0); Green + Lab + RUK with 375 seats (57.7%, ideological distance: 12.0); Ind + Lab + RUK with 354 seats (54.5%, ideological distance: 16.0); Ind + Green + Con + RUK with 337 seats (51.8%, ideological distance: 29.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition Green-Lab-LD: Green: left_to_right = 2 Lab: left_to_right = 3 LD: left_to_right = 4 Ideologische Distanz = |2-3| + |2-4| + |3-4| = 4](../plots/uk2024_italy_coalitions.png)
