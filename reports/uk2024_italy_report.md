## Seat Calculation Process

## French Electoral System Explanation

This election uses the French two-round voting system (scrutin uninominal majoritaire à deux tours):

1. **First Round**
   - All candidates can participate
   - If a candidate receives >50% of votes AND ≥25% of registered voters, they win immediately
   - Otherwise, qualified candidates proceed to second round

2. **Second Round Qualification**
   - Candidates need ≥12.5% of votes to qualify
   - If no candidates reach 12.5%, top two advance
   - When no second round data is provided, votes are simulated:
     * 80% of votes from eliminated parties go to parties with same left-right position
     * 30% of remaining votes go to parties within 1 position on left-right scale
     * Other votes are considered lost/abstentions

Key Features:
- 650 total seats to be distributed
- Single-member constituencies
- Two rounds if no absolute majority in first round

3. **Seat Scaling**
   When the required number of seats (650) differs from the number of districts (650),
   we use proportional scaling to maintain fair representation:
   - First calculate results for all districts
   - Then multiply each party's seats by (total_seats / number_of_districts)
   - Round to nearest whole number while preserving total seats
   - This maintains the proportional representation from the district results
   
   Example: If we have 100 districts but need 200 seats:
   - Party A wins 60 districts → scaled to 120 seats (60 * 200/100)
   - Party B wins 40 districts → scaled to 80 seats (40 * 200/100)
   The relative strength of each party remains the same.

## Visualizations
### Parliament Seating
![Parliament seating arrangement with 650 total seats. Parties from left to right: Ind with 28 seats (4.3%), Green with 49 seats (7.5%), Lab with 228 seats (35.1%), LD with 85 seats (13.1%), Con with 162 seats (24.9%), RUK with 98 seats (15.1%). Hinweis: Mandatsstimmen (Erststimmen) werden (auch) wie Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen) gewertet](../plots/uk2024_italy_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab + Con with 390 seats (60.0%, ideological distance: 4.0); Green + Lab + LD with 362 seats (55.7%, ideological distance: 4.0); Lab + RUK with 326 seats (50.2%, ideological distance: 5.0); Ind + Lab + LD with 341 seats (52.5%, ideological distance: 8.0); LD + Con + RUK with 345 seats (53.1%, ideological distance: 8.0); Lab + LD + RUK with 411 seats (63.2%, ideological distance: 10.0); Green + Lab + RUK with 375 seats (57.7%, ideological distance: 12.0); Ind + Lab + RUK with 354 seats (54.5%, ideological distance: 16.0); Ind + Green + Con + RUK with 337 seats (51.8%, ideological distance: 29.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition Green-Lab-LD: Green: left_to_right = 2 Lab: left_to_right = 3 LD: left_to_right = 4 Ideologische Distanz = |2-3| + |2-4| + |3-4| = 4](../plots/uk2024_italy_coalitions.png)
