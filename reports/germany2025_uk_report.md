## Seat Calculation Process

## French Electoral System Explanation

This election uses the French two-round voting system (scrutin uninominal majoritaire à deux tours):

1. **First Round**
   - All candidates can participate
   - If a candidate receives >50% of votes AND ≥25% of registered voters, they win immediately
   - Otherwise, qualified candidates proceed to second round

2. **Second Round Qualification**
   - Candidates need ≥12.5% of votes to qualify
   - If no candidates reach 12.5%, top two advance
   - When no second round data is provided, votes are simulated:
     * 80% of votes from eliminated parties go to parties with same left-right position
     * 30% of remaining votes go to parties within 1 position on left-right scale
     * Other votes are considered lost/abstentions

Key Features:
- 630 total seats to be distributed
- Single-member constituencies
- Two rounds if no absolute majority in first round

3. **Seat Scaling**
   When the required number of seats (630) differs from the number of districts (299),
   we use proportional scaling to maintain fair representation:
   - First calculate results for all districts
   - Then multiply each party's seats by (total_seats / number_of_districts)
   - Round to nearest whole number while preserving total seats
   - This maintains the proportional representation from the district results
   
   Example: If we have 100 districts but need 200 seats:
   - Party A wins 60 districts → scaled to 120 seats (60 * 200/100)
   - Party B wins 40 districts → scaled to 80 seats (40 * 200/100)
   The relative strength of each party remains the same.

## Seat Scaling Applied

| AfD | 45 | 15.1% |
| SPD | 39 | 13.0% |
| GRÜNE | 11 | 3.7% |

### After Scaling (630 seats)
| Party | Seats | Percentage | Change |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| CDU/CSU | 417 | 66.2% | -0.0% |
| AfD | 95 | 15.1% | +0.0% |
| SPD | 82 | 13.0% | -0.0% |
| GRÜNE | 23 | 3.7% | -0.0% |
| Die Linke | 13 | 2.1% | +0.1% |


Scaling Details:

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): CDU/CSU with 400 seats (63.5%, ideological distance: 0.0); SPD + CDU/CSU with 495 seats (78.6%, ideological distance: 2.0); CDU/CSU + AfD with 497 seats (78.9%, ideological distance: 2.0); GRÜNE + CDU/CSU with 425 seats (67.5%, ideological distance: 4.0); Die Linke + CDU/CSU with 413 seats (65.6%, ideological distance: 5.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (CDU/CSU): CDU/CSU: left_to_right = 6 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/germany2025_uk_coalitions.png)
