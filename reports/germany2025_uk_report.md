## Seat Calculation Process

# United Kingdom Electoral System
The UK uses First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting where:
- Each constituency (district) elects one Member of Parliament (MP)
- The candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins that seat
- No minimum threshold is required
- Normally, the total number of seats equals the number of constituencies (299 in this dataset)

In this calculation, the target number of seats is 630, which differs from the number of constituencies. This means we will need to scale the results proportionally after determining constituency winners.


## Constituency: Hameln-Pyrmont – Holzminden
This constituency demonstrates how First-Past-The-Post works:

## Scaling Process Explanation
The UK system needs to scale from 299 constituencies to 630 total seats.

This scaling maintains proportionality through these steps:
1. Calculate scaling factor: 630 seats ÷ 299 constituencies = 2.1070
2. Multiply each party's constituency seats by this factor
3. Take the integer part first (floor)
4. Distribute remaining seats by highest decimal remainder

This preserves the proportional relationship between parties while reaching the target seat count.

Original seat distribution (showing only parties that won seats):
{
  "AfD": "46 seats (15.4%)",
  "Die Linke": "6 seats (2.0%)",
  "GR\u00dcNE": "12 seats (4.0%)",
  "SPD": "45 seats (15.1%)",
  "CDU/CSU": "190 seats (63.5%)"
}

Final seat distribution after scaling (showing only parties that won seats):
{
  "AfD": "97 seats (15.4%)",
  "Die Linke": "13 seats (2.1%)",
  "GR\u00dcNE": "25 seats (4.0%)",
  "SPD": "95 seats (15.1%)",
  "CDU/CSU": "400 seats (63.5%)"
}

Note how the percentage of seats for each party remains nearly identical after scaling,
demonstrating that the proportional relationships are preserved.

### Parliament Seating

Parties from left to right: Die Linke with 13 seats (2.1%), GRÜNE with 25 seats (4.0%), SPD with 95 seats (15.1%), CDU/CSU with 400 seats (63.5%), AfD with 97 seats (15.4%).

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): CDU/CSU with 400 seats (63.5%, ideological distance: 0.0); SPD + CDU/CSU with 495 seats (78.6%, ideological distance: 2.0); CDU/CSU + AfD with 497 seats (78.9%, ideological distance: 2.0); GRÜNE + CDU/CSU with 425 seats (67.5%, ideological distance: 4.0); Die Linke + CDU/CSU with 413 seats (65.6%, ideological distance: 5.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (CDU/CSU): CDU/CSU: left_to_right = 6 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/germany2025_uk_coalitions.png)
