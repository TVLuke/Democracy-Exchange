## Seat Calculation Process

# United Kingdom Electoral System
The UK uses First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting where:
- Each constituency (district) elects one Member of Parliament (MP)
- The candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins that seat
- No minimum threshold is required
- Normally, the total number of seats equals the number of constituencies (650 in this dataset)

In this calculation, the target number of seats is 650, which differs from the number of constituencies. This means we will need to scale the results proportionally after determining constituency winners.



## Constituency: Coatbridge and Bellshill

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab with 411 seats (63.2%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SNP with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + PC with 415 seats (63.8%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SDLP with 413 seats (63.5%, ideological distance: 0.0); Green + Lab with 415 seats (63.8%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + LD with 483 seats (74.3%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + APNI with 412 seats (63.4%, ideological distance: 1.0); SF + Lab with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 2.0); Ind + Lab with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 3.0); Lab + UUP with 412 seats (63.4%, ideological distance: 3.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (Lab): Lab: left_to_right = 3 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/uk2024_uk_coalitions.png)
