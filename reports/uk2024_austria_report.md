## Seat Calculation Process

## Austrian Electoral System Explanation

This election is calculated using the Austrian three-tier proportional representation system:

1. **Regional Constituency Level (Regionalwahlkreise)**
   - In this election: 650 regional constituencies across 12 states
     (The Austrian system typically has 39 constituencies across 9 states)
   - First distribution of seats using the Hare quota
   - Only parties that reach 4% nationally can receive seats
   - Direct mandates are awarded at this level

2. **State Level (Landeswahlkreise)**
   - States in this election:
     - East Midlands: 47 constituencies
     - East of England: 61 constituencies
     - London: 75 constituencies
     - North East: 27 constituencies
     - North West: 73 constituencies
     - Northern Ireland: 18 constituencies
     - Scotland: 57 constituencies
     - South East: 91 constituencies
     - South West: 58 constituencies
     - Wales: 32 constituencies
     - West Midlands: 57 constituencies
     - Yorkshire and The Humber: 54 constituencies
   - Second distribution using state-level electoral numbers
   - Remaining seats distributed using D'Hondt method
   - Takes into account seats already won at regional level

3. **Federal Level (Bundesebene)**
   - Final distribution of remaining seats
   - Uses Hare quota at national level
   - Ensures overall proportional representation
   - Compensates for any disproportions from lower levels

Key Features:
- 4% threshold nationally or one direct mandate required
- 650 total seats to be distributed (Austrian National Council has 183)
- Seats first allocated to states based on citizen population



## Vote Type Used for Calculation

Using mandate votes (Erststimmen) for calculations since no list votes are available. In the Austrian system, list votes would typically be used if available.

## State Level Distribution

According to §1 of the Nationalrats-Wahlordnung, the 650 seats are distributed among the states based on their citizen population.

The process:
1. Calculate state-level electoral number (Wahlzahl)
   For each state, the Wahlzahl is calculated as: Total valid votes ÷ (Number of seats + 1)
   Example for a state with 100,000 votes and 4 seats:
   Wahlzahl = 100,000 ÷ (4 + 1) = 20,000

2. Calculate Verhältniszahl (proportional number)
   Total population value: 67,595,581
   Total seats: 650
   Verhältniszahl = 67,595,581 ÷ 650 = 103,993.20
   This number represents how many population one mandate represents.

3. Determine remaining seats after direct mandates
4. Use D'Hondt method for remaining seats
5. Take into account party threshold requirement



## Final Distribution Summary

After completing all three levels of calculation:
1. Regional constituency direct mandates
2. State-level D'Hondt distribution
3. Federal level compensation

Final Results:
- Lab: 242 seats (37.2%) from 9,708,716 votes (33.7%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- Con: 170 seats (26.2%) from 6,828,925 votes (23.7%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- RUK: 102 seats (15.7%) from 4,117,610 votes (14.3%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- LD: 88 seats (13.5%) from 3,519,143 votes (12.2%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- Green: 48 seats (7.4%) from 1,944,501 votes (6.8%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold

This distribution reflects the principles of proportional representation while accounting for:
- The 4% threshold requirement or direct mandate qualification
- Regional constituency direct mandates
- State-level proportionality using D'Hondt method
- Federal level compensation to ensure overall proportionality

### Parliament Seating

Hinweis: Mandatsstimmen (Erststimmen) werden (auch) wie Listenstimmen (Zweitstimmen) gewertet](../plots/uk2024_austria_parliament.png)

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab + LD with 330 seats (50.8%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + Con with 412 seats (63.4%, ideological distance: 4.0); Lab + RUK with 344 seats (52.9%, ideological distance: 5.0); LD + Con + RUK with 360 seats (55.4%, ideological distance: 8.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition LD-Con-RUK: LD: left_to_right = 4 Con: left_to_right = 7 RUK: left_to_right = 8 Ideologische Distanz = |4-7| + |4-8| + |7-8| = 8](../plots/uk2024_austria_coalitions.png)
