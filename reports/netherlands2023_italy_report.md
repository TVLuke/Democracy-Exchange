## Seat Calculation Process

## French Electoral System Explanation

This election uses the French two-round voting system (scrutin uninominal majoritaire à deux tours):

1. **First Round**
   - All candidates can participate
   - If a candidate receives >50% of votes AND ≥25% of registered voters, they win immediately
   - Otherwise, qualified candidates proceed to second round

2. **Second Round Qualification**
   - Candidates need ≥12.5% of votes to qualify
   - If no candidates reach 12.5%, top two advance
   - When no second round data is provided, votes are simulated:
     * 80% of votes from eliminated parties go to parties with same left-right position
     * 30% of remaining votes go to parties within 1 position on left-right scale
     * Other votes are considered lost/abstentions

Key Features:
- 150 total seats to be distributed
- Single-member constituencies
- Two rounds if no absolute majority in first round

3. **Seat Scaling**
   When the required number of seats (150) differs from the number of districts (19),
   we use proportional scaling to maintain fair representation:
   - First calculate results for all districts
   - Then multiply each party's seats by (total_seats / number_of_districts)
   - Round to nearest whole number while preserving total seats
   - This maintains the proportional representation from the district results
   
   Example: If we have 100 districts but need 200 seats:
   - Party A wins 60 districts → scaled to 120 seats (60 * 200/100)
   - Party B wins 40 districts → scaled to 80 seats (40 * 200/100)
   The relative strength of each party remains the same.

## Seat Scaling Applied

Scaling from 19 districts to 150 total seats:

### Before Scaling (19 seats)
| Party | Seats | Percentage |
|-------|--------|------------|
| PVV | 14 | 73.7% |
| GL-PvdA | 4 | 21.1% |
| NSC | 1 | 5.3% |


### After Scaling (150 seats)
| Party | Seats | Percentage | Change |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| PVV | 110 | 73.3% | -0.4% |
| GL-PvdA | 32 | 21.3% | +0.3% |
| NSC | 8 | 5.3% | +0.1% |


Scaling Details:
- Scaling factor: 7.895
- Each party's seats multiplied by this factor and rounded
- Total seats preserved through rounding adjustments
- Percentages of total seats remain nearly identical


## Visualizations
### Parliament Seating

Parties from left to right: GL-PvdA with 27 seats (18.0%), SP with 7 seats (4.7%), D66 with 12 seats (8.0%), NSC with 22 seats (14.7%), CDA with 7 seats (4.7%), VVD with 27 seats (18.0%), BBB with 9 seats (6.0%), PVV with 39 seats (26.0%).

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): NSC + VVD + PVV with 88 seats (58.7%, ideological distance: 6.0); GL-PvdA + NSC + VVD with 76 seats (50.7%, ideological distance: 8.0); D66 + VVD + PVV with 78 seats (52.0%, ideological distance: 8.0); CDA + VVD + BBB + PVV with 82 seats (54.7%, ideological distance: 9.0); NSC + CDA + BBB + PVV with 77 seats (51.3%, ideological distance: 10.0); GL-PvdA + D66 + PVV with 78 seats (52.0%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + NSC + PVV with 88 seats (58.7%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + VVD + PVV with 93 seats (62.0%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + NSC + CDA + VVD with 83 seats (55.3%, ideological distance: 12.0); D66 + NSC + CDA + PVV with 80 seats (53.3%, ideological distance: 12.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition NSC-VVD-PVV: NSC: left_to_right = 5 VVD: left_to_right = 6 PVV: left_to_right = 8 Ideologische Distanz = |5-6| + |5-8| + |6-8| = 6](../plots/netherlands2023_italy_coalitions.png)
