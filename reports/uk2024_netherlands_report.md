## Seat Calculation Process

# Dutch Electoral System

The Netherlands uses a party-list proportional representation system with the following key features:

## Electoral Threshold (Kiesdeler)
- The electoral threshold is 1/650th of the total valid votes (44,271 votes in this election)
- While the Dutch parliament normally has 150 seats, in this calculation we use 650 seats
- Only parties that reach this threshold can receive seats
- With 650 seats, parties need 0.15% of the total vote to enter parliament

## D'Hondt Method
- Seats are allocated using the D'Hondt method
- Each party's votes are divided by 1, 2, 3, etc. as they win seats
- The party with the highest quotient gets the next seat
- This process continues until all 650 seats are allocated

## Qualified Parties
The following parties reached the electoral threshold:
Con, Lab, LD, RUK, Green, SNP, PC, DUP, SF, SDLP, UUP, APNI, Ind

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab + Con with 377 seats (58.0%, ideological distance: 4.0); Green + Lab + LD with 345 seats (53.1%, ideological distance: 4.0); LD + Con + RUK with 330 seats (50.8%, ideological distance: 8.0); Lab + SNP + RUK with 331 seats (50.9%, ideological distance: 10.0); Lab + LD + RUK with 395 seats (60.8%, ideological distance: 10.0); Green + Lab + RUK with 359 seats (55.2%, ideological distance: 12.0); Ind + Lab + SNP + LD with 340 seats (52.3%, ideological distance: 12.0); Ind + Lab + PC + LD with 328 seats (50.5%, ideological distance: 12.0); Ind + Lab + LD + APNI with 326 seats (50.2%, ideological distance: 13.0); Ind + SF + Lab + LD with 328 seats (50.5%, ideological distance: 14.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition Green-Lab-LD: Green: left_to_right = 2 Lab: left_to_right = 3 LD: left_to_right = 4 Ideologische Distanz = |2-3| + |2-4| + |3-4| = 4](../plots/uk2024_netherlands_coalitions.png)
