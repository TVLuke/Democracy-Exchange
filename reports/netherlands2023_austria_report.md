## Seat Calculation Process

## Austrian Electoral System Explanation

This election is calculated using the Austrian three-tier proportional representation system:

1. **Regional Constituency Level (Regionalwahlkreise)**
   - In this election: 19 regional constituencies across 14 states
     (The Austrian system typically has 39 constituencies across 9 states)
   - First distribution of seats using the Hare quota
   - Only parties that reach 4% nationally can receive seats
   - Direct mandates are awarded at this level

2. **State Level (Landeswahlkreise)**
   - States in this election:
     - Amsterdam: 1 constituencies
     - Drenthe: 1 constituencies
     - Flevoland: 1 constituencies
     - Friesland: 1 constituencies
     - Gelderland: 2 constituencies
     - Groningen: 1 constituencies
     - Limburg: 1 constituencies
     - Noord-Brabant: 2 constituencies
     - Noord-Holland: 2 constituencies
     - Overijssel: 1 constituencies
     - Rotterdam: 1 constituencies
     - Utrecht: 1 constituencies
     - Zeeland: 1 constituencies
     - Zuid-Holland: 3 constituencies
   - Second distribution using state-level electoral numbers
   - Remaining seats distributed using D'Hondt method
   - Takes into account seats already won at regional level

3. **Federal Level (Bundesebene)**
   - Final distribution of remaining seats
   - Uses Hare quota at national level
   - Ensures overall proportional representation
   - Compensates for any disproportions from lower levels

Key Features:
- 4% threshold nationally or one direct mandate required
- 150 total seats to be distributed (Austrian National Council has 183)
- Seats first allocated to states based on citizen population

The Hare quota is used to determine direct mandates.
Parties must either win a direct mandate or reach the 4% national threshold.


## State Level Distribution

According to §1 of the Nationalrats-Wahlordnung, the 150 seats are distributed among the states based on their citizen population.

The process:
1. Calculate state-level electoral number (Wahlzahl)
   For each state, the Wahlzahl is calculated as: Total valid votes ÷ (Number of seats + 1)
   Example for a state with 100,000 votes and 4 seats:
   Wahlzahl = 100,000 ÷ (4 + 1) = 20,000

2. Calculate Verhältniszahl (proportional number)
   Total population value: 16,585,208
   Total seats: 150
   Verhältniszahl = 16,585,208 ÷ 150 = 110,568.05
   This number represents how many citizens one mandate represents.

3. Determine remaining seats after direct mandates
4. Use D'Hondt method for remaining seats
5. Take into account party threshold requirement



## Final Distribution Summary

After completing all three levels of calculation:
1. Regional constituency direct mandates
2. State-level D'Hondt distribution
3. Federal level compensation

Final Results:
- PVV: 45 seats (30.0%) from 2,450,453 votes (23.5%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- GL-PvdA: 30 seats (20.0%) from 1,642,523 votes (15.8%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- VVD: 29 seats (19.3%) from 1,589,085 votes (15.2%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- NSC: 25 seats (16.7%) from 1,342,959 votes (12.9%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- D66: 12 seats (8.0%) from 655,250 votes (6.3%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold
- BBB: 9 seats (6.0%) from 485,354 votes (4.7%)
  → Qualified through 4% threshold

This distribution reflects the principles of proportional representation while accounting for:
- The 4% threshold requirement or direct mandate qualification
- Regional constituency direct mandates
- State-level proportionality using D'Hondt method
- Federal level compensation to ensure overall proportionality

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): VVD + BBB + PVV with 83 seats (55.3%, ideological distance: 4.0); NSC + VVD + PVV with 99 seats (66.0%, ideological distance: 6.0); NSC + BBB + PVV with 79 seats (52.7%, ideological distance: 6.0); GL-PvdA + NSC + VVD with 84 seats (56.0%, ideological distance: 8.0); D66 + NSC + PVV with 82 seats (54.7%, ideological distance: 8.0); D66 + VVD + PVV with 86 seats (57.3%, ideological distance: 8.0); GL-PvdA + D66 + PVV with 87 seats (58.0%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + NSC + PVV with 100 seats (66.7%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + VVD + PVV with 104 seats (69.3%, ideological distance: 12.0); GL-PvdA + BBB + PVV with 84 seats (56.0%, ideological distance: 12.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition VVD-BBB-PVV: VVD: left_to_right = 6 BBB: left_to_right = 6 PVV: left_to_right = 8 Ideologische Distanz = |6-6| + |6-8| + |6-8| = 4](../plots/netherlands2023_austria_coalitions.png)
