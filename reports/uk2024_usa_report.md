## Seat Calculation Process

# United States House of Representatives Electoral System
The US uses First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting where:
- Each congressional district elects one Representative
- The candidate with the most votes (plurality) in each district wins that seat
- No minimum vote threshold is required
- Districts are redrawn every 10 years following the census
- Each state is guaranteed at least one Representative

In this calculation:
- Number of districts: 650
- Target number of seats: 650

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): Lab with 411 seats (63.2%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SNP with 420 seats (64.6%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + PC with 415 seats (63.8%, ideological distance: 0.0); Lab + SDLP with 413 seats (63.5%, ideological distance: 0.0); Green + Lab with 415 seats (63.8%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + LD with 483 seats (74.3%, ideological distance: 1.0); Lab + APNI with 412 seats (63.4%, ideological distance: 1.0); SF + Lab with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 2.0); Ind + Lab with 418 seats (64.3%, ideological distance: 3.0); Lab + UUP with 412 seats (63.4%, ideological distance: 3.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für eine Einzelpartei-Mehrheit (Lab): Lab: left_to_right = 3 Ideologische Distanz = 0 (Einzelpartei)](../plots/uk2024_usa_coalitions.png)
