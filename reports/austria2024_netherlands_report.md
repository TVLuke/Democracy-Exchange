## Seat Calculation Process

## French Electoral System Explanation

This election uses the French two-round voting system (scrutin uninominal majoritaire à deux tours):

1. **First Round**
   - All candidates can participate
   - If a candidate receives >50% of votes AND ≥25% of registered voters, they win immediately
   - Otherwise, qualified candidates proceed to second round

2. **Second Round Qualification**
   - Candidates need ≥12.5% of votes to qualify
   - If no candidates reach 12.5%, top two advance
   - When no second round data is provided, votes are simulated:
     * 80% of votes from eliminated parties go to parties with same left-right position
     * 30% of remaining votes go to parties within 1 position on left-right scale
     * Other votes are considered lost/abstentions

Key Features:
- 183 total seats to be distributed
- Single-member constituencies
- Two rounds if no absolute majority in first round

3. **Seat Scaling**
   When the required number of seats (183) differs from the number of districts (39),
   we use proportional scaling to maintain fair representation:
   - First calculate results for all districts
   - Then multiply each party's seats by (total_seats / number_of_districts)
   - Round to nearest whole number while preserving total seats
   - This maintains the proportional representation from the district results
   
   Example: If we have 100 districts but need 200 seats:
   - Party A wins 60 districts → scaled to 120 seats (60 * 200/100)
   - Party B wins 40 districts → scaled to 80 seats (40 * 200/100)
   The relative strength of each party remains the same.

### Coalition Possibilities
![Possible coalition combinations that form a majority, sorted by ideological distance (smaller distance means parties are closer on the left-right spectrum): ÖVP + FPÖ with 103 seats (56.3%, ideological distance: 1.0); SPÖ + FPÖ with 93 seats (50.8%, ideological distance: 4.0); SPÖ + GRÜNE + ÖVP with 103 seats (56.3%, ideological distance: 6.0); SPÖ + NEOS + ÖVP with 105 seats (57.4%, ideological distance: 6.0); SPÖ + GRÜNE + FPÖ with 108 seats (59.0%, ideological distance: 8.0); SPÖ + NEOS + FPÖ with 110 seats (60.1%, ideological distance: 8.0); BIER + SPÖ + FPÖ with 96 seats (52.5%, ideological distance: 10.0); LMP + SPÖ + FPÖ with 94 seats (51.4%, ideological distance: 10.0); KPÖ + SPÖ + FPÖ with 97 seats (53.0%, ideological distance: 10.0); KEINE + SPÖ + FPÖ with 94 seats (51.4%, ideological distance: 10.0). Die "Ideologische Distanz": Für die Darstellung in korrekter Reihenfolge hat jede Partei einen left_to_right-Wert, mit 1 für die Partei, welche üblicherweise im Parlament ganz links sitzt, dann aufsteigend: Dieser Wert wird hier auch einfach als Distanzwert gewertet, um wahrscheinliche Koalitionen darzustellen. Diese Berechnung ist natürlich stark vereinfachend und in vielen Fällen einfach falsch.  Beispiel für die Koalition SPÖ-GRÜNE-ÖVP: SPÖ: left_to_right = 1 GRÜNE: left_to_right = 2 ÖVP: left_to_right = 4 Ideologische Distanz = |1-2| + |1-4| + |2-4| = 6](../plots/austria2024_netherlands_coalitions.png)
